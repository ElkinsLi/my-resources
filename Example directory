# Instructions 

The aim of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to sharpen your skills in using ggplot(). While some of the plots you create may resemble those we covered in class, it is essential that they are original. 
 
 Rules for the Assignment:
 
 1.All data sets except iris are fair game. That includes past data sets used in the class, sets built into R, your own data, and even online data.
 
 2. All graphs must include axis labels, plot title, a theme of your choice, and a brief description/interpretation of the plot (2-3 sentences).


It's worth noting that ggplot() is a widely-used tool, and there are numerous online resources available for you to explore. We strongly recommend that you take advantage of these resources to deepen your understanding of ggplot().

# 1. Make a Scatter Plot With Customized Point Size and Transparency (3pts)

*******

Description and Interpretation: This grpah is a point graph with HP on the y-axis and mpg on the x-axis. I have changed the labels and the point size

```{r}
####
#01#
####

data(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "MPG vs Horsepower",
       x = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)", y = "Horsepower (HP)")
  
 
  ### This grpah is a point graph with HP on the y-axis and mpg on the x-axis. I have changed the labels and the point size

```

*******

# 2. Fit a Line Through Your Scatter Plot From 1. (3pts)

*******

Description and Interpretation: this is a linear regression line through the data indicated by the lm in method. the line is fit to a x^2 regression

```{r}
####
#02#
####
#your code here

data(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",  formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "MPG vs Horsepower",
       x = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)", y = "Horsepower (HP)")

### this is a linear regression line through the data indicated by the lm in method. the line is fit to a x^2 regression

```

# 3. Set the transparency, shape, and color of your graph from 1 based on expressions. Scale the color. (3pts)

*******

Description and Interpretation: i have created a color gradient for the points. the more red ones are lower mpg. To do this i used the scale_color_gradient function

```{r}
####
#03#
####
#your code here
transparency_expr <- 0.7
shape_expr <- 19

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = transparency_expr, shape = shape_expr) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "green") +
  labs(title = "MPG vs Horsepower with Fitted Line",
       x = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)", y = "Horsepower (HP)")

### i have created a color gradient for the points. the more red ones are lower mpg. To do this i used the scale_color_gradient function

```

*******

# 4. Make a Boxplot With Customized Boxplot Width (3pts)

*******

Description and Interpretation: this is a boxplot comparing mpg to number of cylinders. the width of the boxplot is set and can be adjusted.

```{r}
####
#04#
####
#your code here

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +  
  labs(title = "MPG by Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)")

### this is a boxplot comparing mpg to number of cylinders. the width of the boxplot is set and can be adjusted.

```

*******

# 5. Overlay the Individual Points Over Your Box Plot From 3. and Adjust the Point Size and Transparency as Needed (3pts)

******

Description and Interpretation: hod some trouble with this one so i consulted the gods. the points overlay function puts the points over the plot but they need to be jittered to be seen easily. this is done with geom_jitter. also added color to the boxplot.

```{r}
####
#05#
####
#your code here
boxplot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, fill = "lightblue") +  
  labs(title = "MPG by Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)")

points_overlay <- boxplot + 
  geom_jitter(aes(color = factor(cyl)), width = 0.2, size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("4" = "red", "6" = "blue", "8" = "green"))

```

# 6. Make a plot and modify the scale in a beneficial way using scale_x_continuous(), scale_y_continuous(), and coordinate_cartesian(). Explain how your modifications to the scales improved the plot. (4pts)

******

Description and Interpretation: this is some of my data. I have used coord_cartesian to set the y-axis to be the same so i can compare methylation levels

```{r}
####
#06#
####
#your code here

control_order <- c("-SAM", "-Enzyme", "-RNA", "U SUB", "C SUB")


data <- read.delim("./TritiumAssaydf.csv", sep=',') %>%
  filter(Enzyme == "2122", Substrate == "1170 23mer" | Substrate == "1259 23mer")%>%
  mutate(Controls = forcats::fct_relevel(Controls, control_order))

TK2122_sum_data <- data %>%
  group_by(Substrate, Controls)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(CPM), sd = sd(CPM), reps = n())

ggplot(data=TK2122_sum_data,aes(x=Controls, y=mean, fill = Substrate)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black", position=position_dodge())+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-sd, ymax=mean+sd), width=.2, position = position_dodge(.9))+
  
  geom_point(data=data, 
             aes(x=Controls, y=CPM), color="black", stat="identity", position = position_dodge(width = .9), size =1)+
  facet_wrap(~Substrate, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2)+
labs(title = "TK2122 methyltransferase Activity", y="CPM", x="")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme( axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
axis.text.x = element_text( size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1 ,color="black"),axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, color="black"),
axis.title = element_text( size = 10),
legend.position ='none' )+
scale_fill_manual(values=c('#008080', '#FF7F50'))+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, max(TK2122_sum_data$mean + TK2122_sum_data$sd) * 1.1))

# 7. Make a New (don't use any plots from 1-4) Plot with facet_wrap() (4pts)

******

Description and Interpretation: here i use facet wrap to seperate my two subtrates 1170 and 1259 23mers. without facet wrap, the 2 graphs would be combined


```{r}
#07#
####
#your code here

data <- read.delim("./TritiumAssaydf.csv", sep=',') %>%

TK2122_sum_data <- data %>%
  group_by(Substrate, Controls)%>%
  summarize(mean = mean(CPM), sd = sd(CPM), reps = n())

# 8. Using the plot from 5, scale the colors and reorder your facet to reverse order. (4pts)

******

Description and Interpretation: here the facet wrap changes the direction of the overlaid points to be reversed using the dir = "v"

```{r}
#08#
####
#your code here

boxplot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, fill = "lightblue") +  
  labs(title = "MPG by Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)")

points_overlay <- boxplot + 
  geom_jitter(aes(color = factor(cyl)), width = 0.2, size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("4" = "red", "6" = "blue", "8" = "green"))  
  

facet_wrap(~cyl, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2, dir = "v")  
  

points_overlay  


### here the facet wrap changes the direction of the overlaid points to be reversed using the dir = "v"

# 9. Make a Plot Using a Geometry That Was Not Covered in Class (4pts)

******

Description and Interpretation: this is a violet plot, I dont think it was covered in class. It is simaler to a box plot but looks cooler

```{r}
####
#09#
####
#your code here 

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of MPG by Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)") +
  theme_minimal()

### this is a violet plot, I dont think it was covered in class. It is simaler to a box plot but looks cooler
```

# 10. Make a Plot Using a ggplot Extension That Was Not Covered in Class. Explain what the extension does. (4pts)

******

Description and Interpretation: this is a histogram extention. I cannot understand why r wont let me install any extentions. I have tried a few and they all say I cant install them on this version of R but i have installed the newest version of R and it still wont work so im throwing in the towel for tonight

```{r}
####
#10#
####
#your code here 

#install.packages("ggalt")

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
#library(ggalt)

### this is a histogram extention. I cannot understand why r wont let me install any extentions. I have tried a few and they all say I cant install them on this version of R but i have installed the newest version of R and it still wont work so im throwing in the towel for tonight
